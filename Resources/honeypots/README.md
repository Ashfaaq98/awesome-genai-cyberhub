# üöÄ LLM-Based Honeypots

> A curated collection of Large Language Model (LLM) resources focused on **designing, deploying, and analyzing data from intelligent, interactive honeypots**.

Welcome to the **LLM-Based Honeypots** section of Awesome GenAI CyberHub! This space is dedicated to exploring how LLMs are being utilized to create more convincing and interactive honeypots that can engage attackers, gather deeper intelligence on their TTPs, and dynamically adapt their responses.
