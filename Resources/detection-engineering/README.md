# üöÄ LLMs in Detection Engineering

> A curated collection of Large Language Model (LLM) resources focused on **automating the creation, validation, and optimization of security detection rules**.

Welcome to the **Detection Engineering** section of Awesome GenAI CyberHub! This space is dedicated to exploring how LLMs are being utilized to translate threat intelligence or attack patterns into effective detection logic (e.g., Sigma, YARA, Snort rules), refine existing detections, and reduce false positives. Here, you'll find links to relevant articles, research papers, tools, datasets, and proof-of-concepts.
