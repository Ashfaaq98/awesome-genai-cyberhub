# ðŸš€ LLMs in Phishing Analysis & Generation

> A curated collection of Large Language Model (LLM) resources focused on **detecting, analyzing, and understanding (or ethically generating) phishing campaigns**.

Welcome to the **Phishing Analysis** section of Awesome GenAI CyberHub! This space is dedicated to exploring how LLMs are being utilized to identify phishing emails and websites, analyze their content and intent, extract indicators, and, conversely (for research and defense), how they might be used to generate sophisticated phishing lures. Here, you'll find links to relevant articles, research papers, tools, datasets, and proof-of-concepts.
