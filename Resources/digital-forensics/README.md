# üöÄ LLMs in Digital Forensics

> A curated collection of Large Language Model (LLM) resources focused on **enhancing and automating Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) processes**.

Welcome to the **Digital Forensics** section of Awesome GenAI CyberHub! This space is dedicated to exploring how LLMs are being utilized to analyze vast amounts of digital evidence, assist in timeline reconstruction, identify relevant artifacts, automate report generation, and overcome challenges in modern forensic investigations. Here, you'll find links to relevant articles, research papers, tools, and discussions.
