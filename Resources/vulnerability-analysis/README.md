# 🚀 LLMs in Vulnerability Analysis

> A curated collection of Large Language Model (LLM) resources focused on **identifying, assessing, and managing software and system vulnerabilities**.

Welcome to the **Vulnerability Analysis** section of Awesome GenAI CyberHub! This space is dedicated to exploring how LLMs are being utilized to assist in code review for security flaws, predict potential vulnerabilities, summarize CVEs, and even aid in exploit development understanding. Here, you'll find links to relevant articles, research papers, tools, datasets, and proof-of-concepts.

### 🛠️  Tools & Frameworks

* 🛠️ [autokaker](https://github.com/ortegaalfredo/autokaker) **[Tool/GitHub]** - A tool for automated vulnerability discovery and annotation using LLMs. It supports APIs like Neuroengine.ai (with Llama3 and other open models) and OpenAI.

* 🛠️ [Vulnhuntr (by protectai)](https://github.com/protectai/vulnhuntr) **[Tool/GitHub]** - A tool designed for zero-shot vulnerability discovery in Python codebases using LLMs (Claude recommended) and static code analysis. It traces code call chains from user input to server output to find complex vulnerabilities like LFI, RCE, XSS, SQLi.

* 🛠️ [SecureSage](https://github.com/WamboDNS/SecureSage) **[Tool/GitHub]** -  Python code reviews for security vulnerabilities. Uses Bandit, AST parsing, and step-by-step reasoning to explain and fix issues.
